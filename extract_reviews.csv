    I highly recommend these boards books for children above 1 year. My kid is so happy flipping the pages and identifying animals, fruits etc. It is very convenient for my kid to hold it as it is of small size and he thoroughly enjoys it. I was so impressed by these books that I gifted these books to my nephew as well.

    I am glad that i bought this set. My baby have learned a lot from this. The size is perfect for babies though it may look small at first glance. Trust me i have tried a bigger book and it was too big so got torn within a week. My baby will read this book as soon as she got up and before going to bed everyday. Totally worth it.

    This is my 3rd purchase and slowly has been my default gift for kids. First birthday along with some toys. They love them and the colours are bright and the book is hard cardboard material so kids can‚Äôt tear it (for the little active kids too)

    Thats the picture of book colors. Now how do you expect me to teach color by this? It should have had only plain color blue. Butterfly sapphire was not required. Same goes with numbers Book is 10cm in length. It's board book..

    It's not books. This are pocket books.Wrong way to sell item by naming BOOKS but actually item's are SMALL POCKET BOOKS.Basically fraud selling of small pocket books on description of Colour printed learning books, actual prices are Rs.100-150.

    A great product to familiarise your toddler with some common names. He can see things and relate. My son enjoys it the most. Dont go by long names. Even if he learns one name from each book & identifies it, its enough. He carries atleast one book everywhere he goes. My son will turn 2 in may.

    Nice product for small babies. You should buy this when your baby is just 1 yr old and he will start liking it and can enjoy it upto 3 yrs or more also. It has animals, fruits, numbers, transportation etc books. Your kid will get familiar with all these things. And most important , develop a love of reading, touching and enjoying books. The product is small, curved corners so that your baby will play and don't get harmed. A must buyüòçüòç

    Books are smaller in size than I thought. Buy my kid loves the transport and animal books. The alphabet book has some weird choices like B for Bear instead of Ball and a few others, so it doesn't work well with most rhymes videos online

    This is the second time I bought this.  I had bought for my daughter and now I got this to gift it to a toddler.  Very good product.  My neighbor kids also come to my hiymuse just to play with those books.  Really engaging for the kids.  My daughter loves those.  And I have these since my daughter was 10 months old  n she is 2 years old now still play with those books.  Has learned many things.

    Bought this for my 1.5 year old boy. He loves these books! We read these everyday and he doesn't get bored looking through the same books over and over again (especially the transport book!). He's already learning and recognizing so many new things. This is such a healthy distraction from cartoons/mobile/TV.Pros:- board books, so will not tear bend easily- rounded edges, will not hurt the child- colourful clear images on every page- 10 topics, so lots to learn- pocket size, so easy to carry aroundLovely set of books to keep your child engaged. I've ordered the second set as well!

I think seller should change the images shown on Amazon website.Amazon is always the best in delivering the item in well packed and on time.Thank you,For making your customers smiling like your company log.

    Actually product quality is good but problem is in every picture their is similarity or repetition of pictures for eg in fruits u normally get to see fruits thats right but in numerical again fruits are repeated so the basic concern is grasping gets confusing for child as vocal sounds are different for same picture ie- 1 numb you see one apple and so on so if that is being rectified the product can be eligible for 5 star. Minor things but it has a huge impact

    It is a perfect gift for my 1.8year old baby.Liked a lot and play with it and start finding the content in it .........I saw some users reviewing here about size of the book...for them i must say these library books are for 1-3year old kids not for the adults to use....

    Go for this without any second thoughts. Book It's on exact size it needs to be. Very easy to carry with infants around. Sturdy. Hard covers. Pictures are real and in white background without any deviation. My baby enjoys seeing it. Good though of having all the basic topics n a single nutshell.The only con I would say is we see few repetitive objects across all the books. I e Brocolli n vegetables and in Green colour as well. This might be corrected to include as many new words/ pictures as possible. Otherwise great buy. No regrets.

    The book has very foolish content for small kids of 2, 3, 4 yrs young kids. They are showing blue color parrot, they show animals guiana pig which is rarely found, they show i for igloo, q for quilt , etc etc so many most difficult animals and birds names which are rarelynused in day to day life and very difficult to learn for 3 yrs old kids. They should have given some daily used content so that kids can easily remember and can use in their day to day life.

    A simple book series with a picture and word per page (except for the abc book's last few crowded pages). A child can learn and improve his/her vocabulary with this series. The pages are completely worn out due to heavy usage almost everyday. A warning for the parents!!!. Be prepared to read this book again and agian with your baby since they may ask for you to read them every single day for more than five to six times!!! For a complete look of the set visit my YouTube channel - gforgratitude, i have fliped through the pages from the whole set.A small thing that i found is that, there are two styles of this book series, with same content but in a different font and picture layout style. So, you may get a random set.

    we bough first set of the same series & we figured that they released second set as well. So, we bought this one without any second thought!We bought it for 350 inr thanks to amazon. Books are just perfect for your small kid. They will play with them as small objects initially & then eventually they will start learning to turn on pages & see different images which are of good color quality. When they grow up, the same set of book will serve as good vocabulary source for learning.

    This set of 10 books is what my three-year-old always asks for, everytime I open my cupboard. This package includes a set of 10 pocket sized cardboard books, one each for fruits, vegetables, modes of transport, wildlife, domestic animals,birds, shapes, colors, numbers, and A to Z. The pics are crystal clear, bright and attractive. Overall quality of the book is worth spending your bucks!The only two negative things I found is that the book consists of all things American. I doubt if parents in India will be able to relate to many fruits, veggies, animals shown in this book, which are not found in India. Can't blame the publisher, as the book set is imported from US.Secondly, I thought the book is of full size, of around the size of an A4 page, but the package arrived too small. It is infact pocket sized books for kids. Otherwise, truly a delight for the little ones to learn while they play! Thumbs Up!

    I have well researched many books & concluded to this one.  I got it for 399 from amazon. Colors are just perfect. You might get feeling that books are small in size.

    Books are way to small for a child to learn. Because a 1 or 2 year old child needs to see bigger pictures in order to understand everything. One should buy individual books rather than this library. A big no this.Hope you all find this helpful!

    Writing this review after 3 months of usage. Very rugged, well build and strong board books. My 9 moth old son (back then) llhad literally abused them to greater lengths but they still are intact. Minor bends here and there which are not uncommon. My son has chewed, poured water, stood on them, Tried to press against the Binding and what not. They still are running strong. The books seem water resistant if not water proof. Coming to the content, they are clear and vibrant. My son has learnt a lot in the last six months. One tip is to read the books to your kids atleast 15 to 20 min every day. They will develop the back of glancing or reading these board books. Can't be more happy. One of the best purchases

    I bought this for my 13 month old son who has just recently shown tendencies to read his books and not chew on them or tear them apart.When I unwrapped the set of books, I felt disappointed as they were smaller in size than I had assumed. But within minutes, I realised that the size was perfect for my son. We spent 40 minutes right away browsing through all the books. Getting that kind of attention span from my son very active son isn't easy usually.Quality and colours are really good. Easy to carry. This book set is a must buy.

    The book box is really good. Initially, my daughter kept playing with it to remove the book and put it back.The book's classification is well thought to give a kid a flavor of different things to visualize. There are minor pictures which could have been done better - such as having pictures of things which we Indians can visualize, and for Nest word, the picture is of a nest with big eggs and everyone's eyes will go on eggs rather than a nest. Anyway, this is quite a minor issue which we will observe in any best books. The book size is small which is just to know before buying but handly for a kid. Overall the quality of information, book, and book box quality make it work buying for a 2-3 years kid.

    The book is nice and I bought it for my year toddler he enjoyed it and developed a liking for it, by just asking him to bring his books he could signal for the library but after a month instead of looking at the books he started nibbling on it, as the books are hardbound he was able to swallow the cardboard making the edges soggy. I have to keep it away now. I try interacting with him orally but somehow I want him to get acquainted with books. The only thing I wish was if the books were washable.

    It is as shown in image. Quality of the book is good, they are board books so not tearable. Shapes, vegetables, transport & colors books cannot be used now as my daughter is just turning a year old but can be used later. In the books for eg. Animal books animals like llama in bird book emu, hornbill; how can 1 year old understand that, books should be simpler for them to understand. I think buying all the books is not needed at once.

    I had earlier purchased books from same publication but single units at a time. I was hoping for similar quality when I ordered in this collection. But it turned out to be a total disappointment, the binding is extremely poor and doesn't look like its going to last long. The thickness of the pages are also not upto the mark. The finish overall is poor

    All the books are very attractive. Images give real feel of animals etc. My 10 months old baby enjoys a lot. He spends a lot of time on these books. Good learning for babies. Though the books are easy to use, (corners are soft etc.) by small babies, but still they can torn if used regularly. Then there are chances they might put or swallow small paper parts of book in their mouth. So keep an eye. Otherwise books are very good.

    I'm not going to lie! They are small books but, board books usually comes in this size.For the price point, this purely is a gem in the category.Best to get started. This is super cool to initiate & nurture reading habits into our little ones. Don't expect your tiny humans to show interest in reading at the very beginning. Allow them to explore the colour/images first. My 7 month old just loves to go through it for the vibrant colours.

    After seeing the reviews I bought but I am not happy with the books. Quality  is good but content is not up to the mark. Alphabets  are small and images are  small. I bought these for my 10month baby so that he enjoys and learn alphabet. Color book doesn‚Äôt show color and alphabet book shows only images not alphabet.
